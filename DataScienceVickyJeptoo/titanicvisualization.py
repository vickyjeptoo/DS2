#for women but not fully. For women the survival chances are higher between 14 and 40.
#For men the probability of survival is very low between the age of 5 and 18, but that isnâ€™t true for women.
# Another thing to note is that infants also have a little bit higher probability of survival.

#Women on port Q and on port S have a higher chance of survival. The inverse is true, if they are at port C.
