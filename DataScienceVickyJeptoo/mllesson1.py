#ML is a process where computers learn from data using specific algorithims
#Once the computer learns from data,they find trends in data, correlation & relationships between variables
#Afterwards the ccomputer can predict,recommend something from the data,plastering,looking at data and getting similar things.
#Types of learning:
#1.Machine Learning and Deep Learning
#ML:
#Supervised and Unsupervised learning
#Supervised-Computers are given inputs and outputs to learn from
    #Classsification and Regression
#Unsupervised-Machine is given inputs but not outputs
    #Clustering

#Deep learning-advanced of ML works more on unsupervised learning
#Example;
